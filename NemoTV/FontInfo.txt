Font families

Android 4.1 adds several more variants of the Roboto font style for a total of 10 variants, and they're all usable by apps. Your apps now have access to the full set of both light and condensed variants.

The complete set of Roboto font variants available is:

Regular
Italic
Bold
Bold-italic
Light
Light-italic
Condensed regular
Condensed italic
Condensed bold
Condensed bold-italic
You can apply any one of these with the new fontFamily attribute in combination with the textStyle attribute.

Supported values for fontFamily are:

"sans-serif" for regular Roboto
"sans-serif-light" for Roboto Light
"sans-serif-condensed" for Roboto Condensed
You can then apply bold and/or italic with textStyle values "bold" and "italic". You can apply both like so: android:textStyle="bold|italic".

You can also use Typeface.create(). For example, Typeface.create("sans-serif-light", Typeface.NORMAL).
